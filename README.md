# upc
 A Universal Polygon Calculator for polygonal paper models

 Attention! This program is no longer being maintained. It has been superceded by the Inkscape extension [Polygen](https://github.com/obzerving/Polygen).

Using Inkscape 1 (beta or higher) you create an .svg file that has two paths that outline silhouette of a simple vase-like shape.  upc.pyw used this file as input and  creates an .svg file  that contains the paths for the shapes necessary to construct the 3d structure,  using polygons.
