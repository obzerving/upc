 A Universal Polygon Calculator for polygonal paper models

Using Inkscape 1 (beta or higher) you create an .svg file that has two paths that outline silhouette of a simple vase-like shape.  upc.pyw used this file as input and  creates an .svg file  that contains the paths for the shapes necessary to construct the 3d structure,  using polygons.
